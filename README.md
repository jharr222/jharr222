- <ins><b>Open EMR Patient Portal Testing</b></ins>


**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates my QA testing skills by evaluating the OpenEMR Patient Portal, an open-source healthcare application widely used by clinics and hospitals. The goal was to validate core patient-facing functionalities and ensure usability, security, and compliance readiness.

 **Objectives**

* Validate authentication, patient dashboard, appointment management, medical records, secure messaging, prescriptions, and profile updates.

* Ensure HIPAA-aligned security practices such as session management and access control.

* Assess mobile responsiveness for patient usability.

 **Tools & Environment**

* Tools: JIRA (bug tracking), Microsoft Word (test plan/report), Excel/Google Sheets (test cases)

* Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop & mobile emulation)

* OS: Windows 11

* Application Version: OpenEMR v7.0.0 (Community Edition)

**Deliverables**

* Test Plan

* Test Cases

* Bug Reports

* Test Summary Report

* Test Execution Summary

Total Test Cases: 46

Passed: 43

Failed: 3

Blocked/Not Executed: 0

Defects Found: 3 (1 Critical, 1 High, 1 Medium)

 **Key Defects Logged**
 
1. Test Case ID	Issue	Severity - UTH_TC_004	System accepted invalid password | High
2. UTH_TC_005	Logout did not invalidate session |	Critical
3. SM_TC_003 Secure message send button unresponsive with large attachments |	Medium

**Key Findings**

* Strong performance in dashboard navigation, appointments, and prescription history.

* Logout session invalidation and input validation require fixes.

* Mobile UI worked but needs improvements for icon clarity.

 **Recommendations**

* Implement server-side session timeout and strict cache controls.

* Add user-friendly error handling for failed logins.

* Enforce file size limits on secure message attachments.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates end-to-end QA testing for a healthcare web application, covering functional, UI, security, and mobile responsiveness testing. It highlights my ability to plan, execute, and report QA efforts with professional documentation.

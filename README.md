<ins><b>Zuri Solutions Website Testing</b></ins>

**Project Overview**

This repository contains my QA Capstone Project for the Zuri Solutions Website, completed as part of my professional QA portfolio. The goal of this project was to apply the full Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) — from requirements analysis through test closure — to ensure the quality and usability of the Zuri Solutions platform.

* Test Plan – Defines scope, objectives, strategy, environment, schedule, and risks.

* Test Cases – Covers functional, usability, and compatibility testing.

* Bug Reports – Documents defects discovered, with reproducible steps.

* Test Summary Report – Captures execution results and recommendations.

**Timeline Overview** – Testing phases from May 30 – June 30.

**Testing Scope**

**In Scope:**

* Navigation (Home, About Us, Services, Mentorship Program, Blog, Contact Us)

* Contact form validation and submission

* Mentorship program checkout flow

* Usability of buttons and links (e.g., “Let’s Get Started,” “Learn More”)

* Cross-browser and mobile compatibility

**Out of Scope:**

* User login/registration (not available on site)

* Backend database validation

* Admin panel or infrastructure-level testing

**Tools & Techniques**

* Tools Used: Microsoft Word, Excel, GitHub

* Testing Types: Functional, Usability, Compatibility

* Defect Tracking: Structured bug reports with reproducible steps

* Documentation: Professional QA artifacts for portfolio showcase



- <ins><b>Open EMR Patient Portal Testing</b></ins>


**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates my QA testing skills by evaluating the OpenEMR Patient Portal, an open-source healthcare application widely used by clinics and hospitals. The goal was to validate core patient-facing functionalities and ensure usability, security, and compliance readiness.

 **Objectives**

* Validate authentication, patient dashboard, appointment management, medical records, secure messaging, prescriptions, and profile updates.

* Ensure HIPAA-aligned security practices such as session management and access control.

* Assess mobile responsiveness for patient usability.

 **Tools & Environment**

* Tools: JIRA (bug tracking), Microsoft Word (test plan/report), Excel/Google Sheets (test cases)

* Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop & mobile emulation)

* OS: Windows 11

* Application Version: OpenEMR v7.0.0 (Community Edition)

**Deliverables**

* Test Plan

* Test Cases

* Bug Reports

* Test Summary Report

* Test Execution Summary

Total Test Cases: 46

Passed: 43

Failed: 3

Blocked/Not Executed: 0

Defects Found: 3 (1 Critical, 1 High, 1 Medium)

 **Key Defects Logged**
 
1. Test Case ID	Issue	Severity - UTH_TC_004	System accepted invalid password | High
2. UTH_TC_005	Logout did not invalidate session |	Critical
3. SM_TC_003 Secure message send button unresponsive with large attachments |	Medium

**Key Findings**

* Strong performance in dashboard navigation, appointments, and prescription history.

* Logout session invalidation and input validation require fixes.

* Mobile UI worked but needs improvements for icon clarity.

 **Recommendations**

* Implement server-side session timeout and strict cache controls.

* Add user-friendly error handling for failed logins.

* Enforce file size limits on secure message attachments.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates end-to-end QA testing for a healthcare web application, covering functional, UI, security, and mobile responsiveness testing. It highlights my ability to plan, execute, and report QA efforts with professional documentation.
